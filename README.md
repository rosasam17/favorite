## Why I Love to Bake Desserts
>1. Baking is an exact science. As long as you follow the recipe's directions closely along with proper measurements and temperatures, it's hard to fail.
>2. It's a relaxing hobby that doesn't require you to think too much since you're just following directions.
>3. My favorite part is being able to bake goods for my friends. Everyone has a different preference for sweets, so I can get creative. I can also decorate them to match whichever occation we're celebrating, or just make them look pretty.
